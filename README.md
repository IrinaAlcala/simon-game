SUMMARY OF THE GAME

Based on the famous electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison. The game works by highlighting squares and playing their corresponding sounds for a brief period of time in a random squence. The user then has to repeat this sequence to progress to the next level.

It also repeats in intervals if a player doesn't move their mouse for a long enough period of time to prompt them to make a move.
